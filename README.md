# noteedit
Script formating text notes from linux command prompt.

It formates lines of text and date as

1 ) some line of text  |date

Part of functions below is still in progress.

It has few settings options
- maximal number of characters (number and disable/enable)
- maximal number of rows (number and disable/enable)
- sort method - date, alphabet, none
- date format (very basic)

If you will editing the script I hope you will not suffer too much from my english.
